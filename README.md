<h1> Introduce </h1> 

I had a similar feeling when I first learned Japanese and a programming language.
When I first came to Japan, I was confident that I would make an effort to break down the language barrier. I was constantly learning and trying to speak.
Through my efforts, I was able to develop my communication skills and guts.

Now, I am working hard to make myself grow as an engineer. I would like to learn and develop various IT technologies and tools, and provide value to companies and society.
My goal is to become a more technically specialized engineer with continuous personal growth.
